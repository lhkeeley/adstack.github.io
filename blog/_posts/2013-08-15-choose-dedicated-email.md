title: Dedicated Email Equals Valuable Customers
author: Lauren Keeley

Let’s face the facts. There are a lot of direct response advertising options for marketers, even for those who have aggressive cost-per-acquisition goals.  If you want to achieve a $1-$2 CPA, chances are there is a solution but what you may not consider is the quality of the customers you are receiving. Wouldn’t it make sense to lower your CPA expectations to get customers who will actually purchase your product and continue to spend over an extended period of time? At AdStack we think yes, and that is why we consistently recommend dedicated email as a channel to acquire valuable leads to our customers.
